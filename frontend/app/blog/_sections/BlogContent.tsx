            1. What is a Skincare Routine?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A skincare routine is a set of daily habits designed to keep your
            skin healthy, hydrated, and protected. Whether you have dry, oily,
            or combination skin, the right routine can help prevent breakouts,
            early signs of aging, and dullness.

            morning and night to keep your skin balanced and protected. In the
            morning, focus on hydration and sun protection, while the nighttime
